# Introduction

The Vinculum Group (TVG) is a sports based executive and sales team leadership development agency.

We are also in the business of making connections thorough a foundation of trust that aim to move the 6 degrees of separation to 1 direct line.

With over two decades of success in college basketball, rooted in successful recruiting and development of players and coaching staffs, TVG has developed a coaching model that can be translated to the executive team down to the sales force.

The building of teams within the business world has never been more prevelant, and the successful joint ventures of development, VC, and sales is paramount to sustainability.

Whereas _disruption_ has become priority one, we aim to build a level of trust that crosses all platforms, enabling a company to not only successfully disrupt but establish a tangible level of corporate leadership and sustainability.

We want to join the forces of those with common goals and resources that can be shared for each other's success; TVG has the tools and relationships necessary to assist in making that a reality in all arenas. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9d44404a-aa79-4fa7-9930-613cfd502b59.jpg)
